# Crop-Suggestion Android Application

The Crop-Suggestion Android Application is designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection and yield prediction. It incorporates both linear regression and random tree algorithms to provide crop yield predictions based on historical data and environmental factors. The application utilizes Kotlin for the Android front-end and Flask for the back-end REST API to deliver accurate and real-time predictions to users.

## Features

- Crop Yield Prediction: The app uses machine learning algorithms to predict crop yield based on historical data and environmental conditions.
- Crop Selection Assistance: Farmers can input their desired crops and receive recommendations based on predicted yields and suitability for their location.
- User-Friendly Interface: The Android front-end provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for seamless navigation and interaction.
- Real-Time Data: The application uses Flask REST API calls to serve real-time data and predictions to users.

## Getting Started

To run the Crop-Suggestion Android Application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Set up the Android development environment with Kotlin support.
3. Install Flask and its dependencies for the back-end server.
4. Create a virtual environment for Flask (optional but recommended).
5. Run the Flask back-end server.
6. Build and run the Android application on an emulator or a physical device.

## Dependencies

The application relies on the following technologies and frameworks:

- Kotlin: For developing the Android application front-end.
- Flask: For implementing the back-end REST API to serve crop yield predictions.
- SQLite: For storing and managing local data on the Android device.
